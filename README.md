## Use Case

This tool is particularly valuable for sales and tech teams, especially in scenarios where efficient troubleshooting for field agents is essential. Consider a situation where you have a distributed team of 300+ field agents across India, all using your in-house apps/software. When minor issues arise, agents can easily communicate their concerns via WhatsApp, owing to its ubiquity and simplicity. At the end of the day, the WhatsApp chat can be seamlessly parsed into a structured CSV file. This parsed data enables trend analysis, the identification of recurring issues, and other insights that drive proactive decision-making.

## Upcoming Enhancements

The following updates are planned:

1. **Enhanced Visual Appeal**: We're working on revamping the site's design to provide a more engaging and visually pleasing experience.
2. **Multi-Line Text Parsing**: We're focused on refining the parsing of multi-line text messages for more accurate and comprehensive results.
